This is the README file for FMSec.

FMSec (File Manager SECurity) is a set of extensions to file managers that
enable some security-related operations to be easily performed.

The operations are:

- encryption and decryption using OpenSSL,
- safe removing (shredding) files and directories,
- mounting and unmounting TrueCrypt and VeraCrypt
  (https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/) volumes,
- wiping the free space on a filesystem using WipeFreeSpace
  (https://wipefreespace.sourceforge.io/).
